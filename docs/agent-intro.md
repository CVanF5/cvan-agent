NGINX powers the digital world with [more than 400 million websites](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2021/02/26/february-2021-web-server-survey.html) relying on its tecnology. Modern app infrastructure, [PlatformOps](https://nginx.org/) and dev teams use NGINX in cloud environments as on-premisses to enable reverse proxy, load balancing, API gateway, content caching and app security use-cases.

The versality of NGINX and its [Open-source root](https://nginx.org/) makes it a de-facto component of Modern applications stacks. However,when building management plan capabilities, how do you efficiently configure NGINX and monitor App and system performance ? That’s where NGINX’s latest Open source project comes in : ** Agent **.

We are pleased to announce ** Agent **, a lightweight piece of software that provides an administrative entry point to remotely manage, configure and collect metrics and events on your NGINX instances. Agent enhances your deployment experience and enables you to monitor your system and app performance. Simply put, Agent optimizes the operationalization of your application stack.  Agent is provided as an [open-source project](https://github.com/nginx/agent) and is ready for interoperability testing, feedback, and code contributions.

## Optimize your deployments and Enable visibility

Agent provides a prowerfull SDK with a set of tools, libraries, documentation, code samples, processes that allows you to optimize your NGINX deployments and enable visibility of your apps systems and applications.
